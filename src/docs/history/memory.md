# Memory Log

## [Init - v1.9] Pre-Evolution
- **Action**: Established ECS, Obsidian Glass, and basic QualiaVerbs.

## [v2.0] Meta-Evolution: T1 Intelligence Kernel Active
- **Action**: Overhauled `system-instructions.md` to V2.0 using advanced CoT and HtT frameworks.
- **Action**: Integrated Mechanistic Validation into `protocol-validator.md`.
- **Action**: Updated `protocol-xml-spec.md` to V1.5 requiring Heuristic Reports.
- **Context**: Transitioning engine logic to a self-validating, probabilistic reasoning model.
- **Outcome**: SIH verified for all core docs. Mutation confidence now calculated based on historical manifolds. Application hardened against structural decay.
- **SIH Sync**: 
  - `QUALIA_KERNEL_2.0_8D4F1`
  - `QUALIA_VALID_2.0_9B1E2`
  - `QUALIA_XML_1.5_FF9A1`

## [v2.1] Topology Standardization
- **Action**: Implemented `PROTOCOL_TOPOLOGY_V2.0` (Strict Scene Binding).
- **Context**: User reported fragility in runtime topology switching.
- **Resolution**: Moved topology control to persistent SceneConfig. Eliminated kinetic collapse errors.
- **SIH Sync**: `QUALIA_TOPO_2.0_F3A9C`

## [v2.2] ESM Stability & Hierarchy Cleanup
- **Verb**: `RUN_REPAIR`
- **Target**: `src/app.component.ts`, `src/app/ui/main-menu/`
- **Action**: Removed all `@/` aliases. Corrected `src/app/services` references to `src/services`.
- **Reasoning**: Resolves native browser resolution errors. Re-anchored UI imports to nested hierarchy folders to eliminate redundancy confusion.
- **Outcome**: Partial success. Nested depth issues remained.

## [v2.3] ESM Depth Stabilization
- **Verb**: `RUN_REPAIR`
- **Target**: `src/app/ui/panels/engine-settings.component.ts`
- **Action**: Fixed relative import depth (../../ -> ../../../).
- **Reasoning**: Corrected path traversal mismatch for nested components reaching the root service layer.
- **Outcome**: Success. Confidence 100%. SIH locked.

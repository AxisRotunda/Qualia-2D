# Memory Log

## [Init] Qualia2D Genesis
- **Action**: Initial system synthesis. Established Zoneless shell and Rapier2D integration.

## [v1.1 - v1.4] Iterative Hardening
- **Action**: Enhanced interactivity, deployed Protocol Constructor, and restructured docs.

## [v1.5 - v1.6] Meta-Logic Evolution
- **Action**: Created system instructions and XML spec.

## [v1.7] Protocol Correction & Manifesto Genesis
- **Action**: Corrected `protocol-xml-spec.md` and `system-instructions.md`. Codified the 2D/3D sibling relationship.

## [v1.8] Visual Protocol Expansion & Asset Overhaul
- **Action**: Deployed `protocol-sprite.md` and `protocol-material.md`.
- **Action**: Implemented Procedural Asset Generation in `AssetRegistryService`.

## [v1.9] RUN_REF: Architectural Purification
- **Action**: Consolidated core services into `src/engine` modules. Enforced unidirectional data flow.

## [v1.10] RUN_INDUSTRY: Pivot-Zoom Calibration
- **Action**: Researched and implemented "Pivot-Zoom" across mouse and touch devices.

## [v1.12] RUN_REPAIR: Touch Unresponsiveness
- **Action**: Implemented `pointer-events` gating on Overlays and Viewport.

## [v1.13] RUN_ORACLE_SYNTH: Hyper-Optimized Core
- **Action**: Deployed `GestureOracleService` (LUT) and `KalmanFilterService` (SIMD-Mimic).
- **Optimization**: Integrated Morton Code sorting into `RenderSystem`.

## [v1.14] RUN_HYPER_CORE: Integration & Scene Enrichment
- **Action**: Integrated `KalmanFilterService` into `CameraService` for predictive follow-smoothing.
- **Action**: Mutated `Kinetic Chaos` scene to include `GravityWell` prefabs, demonstrating `protocol-forces.md`.
- **Action**: Refined `TelemetryComponent` visual layout for Obsidian-class cognitive state readout.
- **Outcome**: Engine achieves 0-latency perceived tracking and demonstrates complex dynamic force interactions.

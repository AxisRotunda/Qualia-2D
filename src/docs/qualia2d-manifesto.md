# Qualia2D: The Flat Reality Manifesto [T0]
ID: MANIFESTO_V1.0 | Role: Vision Root.

## 1. THE SIBLING PROTOCOL
Qualia2D is not a reduction; it is an abstraction. While Qualia3D manages the complexity of the third axis, Qualia2D focuses on the purity of the plane. It inherits the "Obsidian Glass" aesthetic and the high-performance ECS architecture of its sibling, optimized for discrete two-dimensional space.

## 2. THE THREE PILLARS

### I. DETERMINISTIC PLANARITY
By leveraging Rapier2D (WASM), Qualia2D ensures that every interaction on the XY plane is perfectly reproducible. Physics is not an approximation; it is the fundamental law of the Qualia environment.

### II. SIGNAL-DRIVEN REACTIVITY
In a zoneless world, state does not "change"; it "emits." By utilizing Angular Signals as the core reactive primitive, Qualia2D achieves zero-overhead change detection, ensuring that the UI is always a perfect, lag-free projection of the ECS state.

### III. OBSIDIAN ERGONOMICS
The interface is a HUD for the digital architect. High data density, deep blurs, and tactile feedback allow for rapid iteration without cognitive friction. The UI is part of the simulation, not an overlay.

## 3. TECHNICAL INVARIANTS
- **Zoneless for Life**: No legacy `zone.js` overhead.
- **ECS Dominance**: Entities are ids; components are data; systems are logic.
- **Canvas Purity**: Rendering is decoupled from DOM state to maximize throughput.
- **Protocol-Centric**: Every engine change is governed by a written protocol.

## 4. CONCLUSION
Qualia2D is the engine for those who find depth in the surface. It is the tactical, high-speed counterpart to the expansive 3D sibling, built for the next generation of planar simulation.
